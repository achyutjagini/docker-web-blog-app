kind: Service

  name: mongodb-service

#This YAML file defines a Service resource in Kubernetes. The Service is named 
#"mongo-express-service" and it
#is used to expose the "mongo-express" application to the network. 
#The Service uses a selector 
#to identify the Pods that make up the "mongo-express" application, and it maps 
#incoming traffic to the appropriate Pod.

#The Service is of type LoadBalancer, which means that it creates an external IP address that can be accessed
# from outside the cluster. Incoming traffic on port 8081 will be redirected to port 8081 on the target Pods, 
#and nodePort is set to 30100, which means that the service can be accessed on a specific
#node IP at the specified port number.
